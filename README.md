# Windows-Components-Tester
a tool I designed that improves upon windowstylebuilders testing tool. It works on windows 8 all the way up to windows 11. Used to test various windows elements when making custom themes. Also works with windowblinds11.

Features:

 Same feel of windows style builder's test function.

 Task Link added to main page for buttons.

 Windows Taskbar progress bar testing tool. Allows you to see the progress bar in real time while you test your themes. (Normal, Paused, Error & Indeterminate)

Windows tab that allows you to check out basic windows and other various windows.

Requires Microsoft .NET Framework 4.7 to function (!!!Only install if the application does not launch on your system!!!): https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet-framework/net47
